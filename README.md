# Unsupervised_Image_Segmentation_Using_K-means_Clustering
 Did this project during completeion of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. Implemented K-means clustering based on RGB values of input color image using OpenCV's Kmeans function and visualized the different deifferent segments of the input image by using klustered pixels as a mask.
