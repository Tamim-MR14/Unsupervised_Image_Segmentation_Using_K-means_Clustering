# Unsupervised_Image_Segmentation_Using_K-means_Clustering
 Did this project during completeion of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. ï‚§	Implemented K-means clustering based on RGB values of input color image using OpenCV's Kmeans function by defining k=3 and criteria for convergence combined of maximum iteration number and epsilon and visualized the different segments of the input image by using clustered pixels as a mask.
